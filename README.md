# Tabletop

This will eventually evolve into some kind of virtual tabletop.

## Prerequisites

Older versions of the below may work but I haven't tested

- `node 12+`
- `yarn 1.22+`
- `yarn global add bs-platform`

## Available commands

- `yarn start` starts watching and building code
- `yarn server` starts dev server
- `yarn test` runs unit tests
- `yarn build` generates a deployable bundle at `/dist`
- `yarn server:prod` serves prod bundle so you can test it locally
- `yarn clean` will get rid of any dev artefacts in case you're in a bad state
